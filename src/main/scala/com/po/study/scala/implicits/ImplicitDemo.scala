/**
  * When the compiler sees the need for an implicit, either because you are calling a method which does not exist on the object's class,
  * or because you are calling a method that requires an implicit parameter, it will search for an implicit that will fit the need.
  *
  * 1. First look in current scope
  * a. Implicits defined in current scope
  * b. Explicit imports
  * c. wildcard imports
  * d. Same scope in other files
  *
  * 2. Now look at associated types in
  * a. Companion objects of a type
  * b. Companion objects of type parameters types
  * c. Outer objects for nested types
  * d. Other dimensions
